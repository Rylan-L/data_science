## Classification Approaches with Machine Learning

### Predicting breast cancer using decision trees

One of the potential transformative applications of machine learning is in the use of medical diagnostics. In this notebook, I explored using decision trees using Gini Indexing or Entropy for splitting. This notebook also demonstrates decision tree visualization, allowing the user to see which attributes and values are useful for predicting cancer in this dataset.

### Predicting a bank customer's purchase using demographics: Random Forests, Gradient-Boosted Decision Trees

A useful business application of machine learning is to predict a customers purchase choice based on their demographics. In this notebook, I explore random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees for predicting whether bank customers will purchase a specific product.

### Support Vector Machine prediciton of the age of Abalone Shellfish using their ring shell

I demonstrate the use support vector machines (SVM) for predicting the number of rings in abalaone shells using other parameters in the dataset such as length and weight. The number of rings are related to the age of the abalone. This notebook also demonstrates the use of GridsearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
